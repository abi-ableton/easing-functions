# Easing functions

In order to use a more vanilla implementation of JS and not some p5 library I created this example project, where you can change the name of the easing function on the X and Y axes and radically change the movement behaviour.

## So you want to build this library

It's straightforward!

1. Clone this
2. Navigate to the repo 
3. Start a web server (`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `$ python -m http.server` is nice and easy, or the built-in one with VS code works too)
4. Navigate to wherever the server suggests
5. Voila!
